# 🚀 Supercharger v1.6 STABLE

After rigorous beta testing, version 1.6 is officially ready for daily use. This monumental update shifts the module from standard script execution to an **Intelligent Hardware Architecture**, explicitly optimized for the Pixel 9 Pro XL's Tensor G4 (Zumapro) kernel.

## 🛠️ What's New in v1.6

### 🛡️ Deep Audit Engine
* **Military-Grade Logging**: The module now features a Deep Audit Engine. Check your `debug.log` to see a detailed `[PASS/FAIL]` report of every hardware and software tweak applied to your device.
* **Prop Verification**: The engine natively verifies Android `resetprop` injections, ensuring the 16GB RAM profile and SkiaVK UI are completely active.

### 🧠 Smart Storage Engine
* **Intelligent Pivot**: Dropped infinite system-fighting loops to save battery. The engine now accepts Google's UFS 4.0 physical Queue Depth limit but compensates by massively boosting `read_ahead_kb` to **1024**.
* **Result**: Lightning-fast I/O operations and app loading times with zero battery drain.

### 🌐 Smart Network Engine
* **Cubic Optimization**: Specifically tuned the `cubic` congestion control for mobile networks.
* **Socket Reuse**: Enabled `tcp_tw_reuse` to instantly recycle dead connections, drastically dropping latency, lag spikes, and ping on 5G and Wi-Fi networks.

### 🚧 Smart IRQ Balancing
* **Hardware Node Tracking**: The custom IRQ balancer now counts and displays the exact number of hardware nodes assigned to specific cores.
* **Touch Priority**: Forced touchpanel interrupts to the Performance Cores (`f0` mask) for absolute zero-lag scrolling.
* **Efficiency**: Network and I/O processes are offloaded to Mid and Efficiency cores, allowing the Cortex-X4 Prime core to enter Deep Sleep faster.

### 🏗️ Global Re-Write
* **English Standard**: The entire codebase, internal logic, and logs have been rewritten in professional technical English.
